Based off of [FirebaseService](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/open-source-firebaseservice/296753)

I really just made this so you can sync your Replit projects with your ROBLOX projects, which actually seems kinda useful for moderation bots.

# Installation

## Wally

Paste this into your wally.toml dependencies:

```

```

Learn more at [wally.run](https://wally.run)

## ModuleScript

Copy and paste [this module script](src/init.lua) into a new module script.

OR

Get this [asset](https://create.roblox.com/marketplace/asset/12789771846/ReplDBService) and put this in your game.
